# Course-IBM-Introduction-to-DevOps

This module is all about thinking DevOps and getting results! You will learn how social coding as a community creates better code. You will examine how creating shared repositories and pair programming results in defects found earlier and a broader understanding of the code base for the team. You will see how working in small batches reduces waste and results in delivering useful applications quickly. You will discover how producing a minimum viable product allows you to test a hypothesis and gain valuable feedback about delivering what the customer really desires. Test driven development will allow you to develop faster and with more confidence. Behavior driven development results in improved communication and more meaningful information from your stakeholders. You will learn how cloud native architecture is used to build resilience in your product and take advantage of horizontal scaling and independently deployable microservices. Failures will happen. You will be able to take advantage of tools that are designed to help you recover quickly from failures.
